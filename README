## Overview

The Arithmetic Expression Interpreter is a program written in C that evaluates 
arithmetic expressions from a text file. It supports operations such as 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and respects 
the conventional order of operations.

## Project Files

-  interpreter.c: The main program file that includes the entry point for 
   interpreting and evaluating expressions.

-  parser.c: Contains the parsing logic to analyze the syntax of each 
   expression.

-  parser.h: The header file for the parser, declaring necessary functions and 
   constants.

-  tokenizer.c: Processes the input text and breaks it into known tokens.

-  tokenizer.h: Header file for the tokenizer with token categories and 
   function prototypes.


Input txt file:
- unix_input.txt: Contains example expressions to be evaluated by the 
  interpreter.

Output txt file:
- unix_output.txt: Output of the interpreter showing the evaluated results 
  or syntax errors.


### How to Compile and Run on Agora

gcc -o interpreter interpreter.c parser.c -lm

./interpreter unix_input.txt unix_output.txt
